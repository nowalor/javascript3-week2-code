// 1. Mark the function as async
// 2. Await the response of fetch with your url
// 3. Await .json() on the response

// 1. Fetch the url
// 2. Chain a .then method that takes a callback and returns response.json()
// 3. Chain another .then that does something with the data

// 1. Make a function that calls the API with async/await and returns the response
// 2. Make a function that calls the API with .then and returns the response
// 3. Make a function that logs the response of any function
// 4. Log out the results of both functions
